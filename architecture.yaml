project: name: Anti-Abuse Voting Prediction System purpose: > Build an open web-based voting and prediction platform that maximizes signal quality while remaining anonymous and accessible.

core_philosophy:

votes are signals, not identities
voting rights must be minted, not guessed
abuse is inevitable and must be priced out
trust is computed, not assumed
system_layers:

edge: description: Cloudflare-based anti-abuse perimeter functions: - tls_fingerprint - browser_behavior - bot_score - turnstile_challenge - rate_limiting

token_mint: description: Voting-right issuance system responsibilities: - receive mint requests - evaluate risk - issue voting tokens - apply delays and throttling - store issuance metadata

risk_engine: description: Probabilistic abuse scoring signals: - cloudflare_bot_score - device_reuse - ip_reuse - mint_rate - vote_pattern

token: properties: - cryptographically random - single use - time limited - bound to risk metadata

vote_api: description: Accepts votes and burns tokens responsibilities: - validate token - ensure unused - record vote - attach metadata

analytics: description: Post-hoc fraud detection and weighting functions: - clustering - anomaly_detection - trust_weighting - retroactive_invalidation

results: description: Public prediction layer outputs: - raw_vote_counts - weighted_predictions - confidence_intervals - manipulation_indicators
